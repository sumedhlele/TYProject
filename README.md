# TYProject
Repository for TYBSc Project of Home Automation using NodeMCU.

Home Automation Systems have achieved significant
importance in the last few decades. Pairing this existing system with
another important field i.e. IoT (Internet of Things) leads to a greater
advantage. These automation systems can monitor various parameters
and control various other systems and devices with respect to the
measured parameters or according to the wish of the user. These
systems can be built using microcontrollers development boards like
NodeMCU, Arduino boards paired with appropriate shields, etc.
These boards can be controlled by the Blynk app with its included
library.
The Home Automation project will control appliances connected to a relay
board through the internet. One is able to control whatever is connected to
the relay module over the internet using the Blynk application. This
minimizes the use of hardware such as buttons. This lets the user automate
his or her tasks through the use of software.
With the use of such a system, people can simplify their everyday tasks by
using only their smartphones to control many and various devices and
appliances. This project is targeted at modern homes and for Content creator
specific uses (such as in studios where controlling various devices needs
lots of movement of the person and job becomes tiring.)
This project was solely based for personal use and does not have any 
security measures other than what are applied by network SSID and Password.
